Step1:

* identify what business process(what happened) is being measured
Taxi-trip transactions from pickup to dropoff

* identify the grain- what each row will represent
Each row represents a unique trip. A transactional-level grain.

* identify business questions(what we want to learn) that are trying to be solved
Geographical demand patterns, temporal(datetime) demand patterns, fleet optimization, revenue analysis, vendor analysis, rate code analysis, payment method analysis, trip classfication
Revenue Analysis: Which vendors, locations, times generate most revenue?
Operational Efficiency: Average trip distances, passenger counts by vendor
Geographic Performance: Revenue by pickup/dropoff zones
Temporal Patterns: Peak hours, seasonal trends
Payment Insights: Tip patterns by payment method
Fleet Optimization: Passenger count patterns for vehicle acquisition

Operational Questions:
Which vendors perform better in terms of trip volume/revenue?
How do different rate codes affect profitability?
What's the impact of connectivity issues (store_and_fwd_flag) on operations?

Geographic Questions:
What are the most popular pickup/dropoff zones?
Which routes generate the highest revenue?
How does demand vary by neighborhood?

Financial Questions:
How do different payment methods correlate with tip amounts?
What's the breakdown of fare components (base fare vs. extras)?
Which time periods generate the highest profit margins?
